There is a ''standard'' set of fonts that has appeared in every PostScript
printer since the second generation of the type.  These fonts
(8&nbsp;families of four text fonts each, and three special-purpose fonts)
are of course widely used, because of their simple availability.  The
set consists of:
  

-  Times family (4 fonts)
-  Palatino family (4 fonts)
-  New Century Schoolbook family (4 fonts)
-  Bookman family (4 fonts)
-  Helvetica family (4 fonts)
-  Avant Garde (4 fonts)
-  Courier family (4 fonts)
-  Utopia family (4 fonts)
-  Zapf Chancery (1 font)
-  Zapf Dingbats (1 font)
-  Symbol (1 font)

All these fonts are supported, for LaTeX users, by the
[`psnfss`](https://ctan.org/pkg/psnfss) set of metrics and support files in the file
`lw35nfss.zip` on CTAN.  Almost any remotely modern TeX
system will have some version of [`psnfss`](https://ctan.org/pkg/psnfss) installed, but
users should note that the most recent version has much improved
coverage of maths with `Times` (see package
[`mathptmx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/mathptmx)) and with `Palatino` (see package
[`mathpazo`](https://ctan.org/pkg/mathpazo), as well as a more reliable set of font metrics.

The archive `lw35nfss.zip` is laid out according to the
TDS, so in principle, installation consists simply of
''unzipping'' the file at the root of a `texmf` tree.

Documentation of the [`psnfss`](https://ctan.org/pkg/psnfss) bundle is provided in
`psnfss2e.pdf` in the distribution.
