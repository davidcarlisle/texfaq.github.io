Knuth has declared that he will do no further development of TeX;
he will continue to fix any bugs that are reported to him (though
bugs are rare).  This decision was made soon after
TeX version&nbsp;3.0 was released; at each bug-fix release
the version number acquires one more digit, so that it tends to the
limit&nbsp;&pi; (at the time of writing, Knuth's latest release
is version 3.1415926).  Knuth wants TeX to be frozen at
version&nbsp;&pi; when he dies; thereafter, no further changes
may be made to Knuth's source.  (A similar rule is applied to MetaFont;
its version number tends to the limit&nbsp;_e_, and currently
stands at 2.718281.)

Knuth explains his decision, and exhorts us all to respect it, in a
paper originally published in 
[TUGboat 11(4)](https://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf),
and reprinted in the 
[NTG journal MAPS](http://www.ntg.nl/maps/pdf/5_34.pdf).

There are projects
to build substantial new macro packages based on TeX: the most notable is
[The LaTeX3 project](FAQ-LaTeX3).  There are
also various projects to build a _successor_ to TeX-the-binary.
The [success of these projects has varied](FAQ-enginedev):
today, [pdfTeX](FAQ-pdftex) is the standard engine for most users,
whilst [XeTeX and LuaTeX](FAQ-xetex-luatex) have both delivered
fully Unicode-compliant systems with contrasting approaches to
extensibility.
