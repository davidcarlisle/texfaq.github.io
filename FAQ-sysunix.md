  Note that Mac OS/X, though it is also a Unix-based system, has
  different options; users should refer to the information in
  [Mac systems](FAQ-sysmac).

The TeX distribution of choice, for Unix systems (including
GNU/Linux and most other free Unix-like systems) is TeX&nbsp;Live,
which is distributed as part of the [TeX collection](FAQ-CD).

TeX&nbsp;Live may also be installed ''over the network''; a network
installer is provided, and once you have a system (whether installed
from the network or installed off-line from a disc) a manager
(`tlmgr`) can both keep your installation up-to-date and add
packages you didn't install at first.

TeX&nbsp;Live may be run with no installation at all; the web page 
[TeX&nbsp;Live portable usage](http://www.tug.org/texlive/portable.html)
describes the options for installing TeX&nbsp;Live on a memory stick for
use on another computer, or for using the TeX&nbsp;Live DVD with
no installation at all.

TeX-gpc is a ''back-to-basics'' distribution of TeX utilities,
_only_ (unlike TeX&nbsp;Live, no ''tailored'' package bundles are
provided).  It is distributed as source, and compiles with GNU
Pascal, thereby coming as close as you're likely to get to Knuth's original
distribution.  It is known to work well, but the omission of &epsilon;-TeX
and pdfTeX will rule it out of many users' choices.
