LaTeX and BibTeX co-operate to offer special treatment of this
requirement.  The command `\nocite{*}` is specially treated,
and causes BibTeX to generate bibliography entries for every entry
in each `bib` file listed in your `\bibliography` statement, so
that after a LaTeX&ndash;BibTeX&ndash;LaTeX sequence, you have a
document with the whole thing listed.

Note that LaTeX _doesn't_ produce
`Citation ... undefined` or
`There were undefined references` warnings in respect of
`\nocite{*}`.  This isn't a problem if you're running
LaTeX ''by hand'' (you _know_ exactly how many times you have
to run things), but the lack might confuse automatic processors that
scan the log file to determine whether another run is necessary.

A couple of packages are available, that aim to reduce the impact of
`\nocite{*}` of a large citation database.  [`Biblist`](https://ctan.org/pkg/Biblist)
was written for use under LaTeX 2.09, but seems to work well enough;
[`listbib`](https://ctan.org/pkg/listbib) is more modern.  Both provide their own
`bst` files.  (The impact of large databases was significant
in the old days of LaTeX systems with very little free memory; this
problem is less significant now than it once was.)
