# Books relevant to TeX and friends

There are too many books for them all to appear in a single list, so
the following answers aim to cover ''related'' books, with subject
matter as follows:
  

-  [TeX itself and Plain TeX](FAQ-tex-books)
-  [LaTeX](FAQ-latex-books)
-  [Books on other TeX-related matters](FAQ-other-books)
-  [Books on Type](FAQ-type-books)

These lists only cover books in English: notices of new books, or
warnings that books are now out of print are always welcome.  However,
these FAQs do _not_ carry reviews of current published
material.
