There's nothing particularly magic about the commands you use when
writing a package, so you can simply bundle up a set of LaTeX
`\(re)newcommand` and `\(re)newenvironment` commands, put them in
a file `package.sty` and you have a package.

However, any but the most trivial package will require rather more
sophistication.  Some details of LaTeX commands for the job are to
be found in "LaTeX2e for class and package writers"
(`clsguide`, part of the LaTeX documentation distribution).
Beyond this, a good knowledge of TeX itself is valuable: thus books
such as the [TeXbook](FAQ-tex-books) or 
[TeX by topic](FAQ-ol-books) are relevant.  With good TeX
knowledge it is possible to use the documented source of LaTeX as
reference material (dedicated authors will acquaint themselves with the
source as a matter of course).  A complete set of the documented
source of LaTeX may be prepared by processing the file
`source2e.tex` in the LaTeX distribution.  Such processing is
noticeably tedious, but Heiko Oberdiek has prepared a well-linked
PDF version, which is in the file `base.tds.zip` of his
`latex-tds` distribution.  Individual files in the LaTeX
distribution may be processed separately with LaTeX, like any
well-constructed [`dtx` file](FAQ-dtx).

Writing good classes is not easy; it's a good idea to read some
established ones (`classes.dtx`, for example, is the documented
source of the standard classes other than [`letter`](https://ctan.org/pkg/letter), and may
itself be formatted with LaTeX).  Classes that are not part of the
distribution are commonly based on ones that are, and start by loading
the standard class with `\LoadClass`&nbsp;&mdash; an example of this
technique may be seen in [`ltxguide.cls`](https://ctan.org/pkg/latex-base)

An 
[annotated version of `article`](https://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb28-1/tb88flynn.pdf),
as it appears in `classes.dtx`, was published in
TUGboat 28(1).  The article, by Peter Flynn, is a good guide to
understanding `classes.dtx`
