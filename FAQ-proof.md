It was long thought impossible to make a `proof`
environment which automatically includes an ''end-of-proof'' symbol.
Some proofs end in displayed maths; others do not.  If the input file
contains 
`...\] \end{proof}` then LaTeX finishes off
the displayed maths and gets ready for a new line before it reads any
instructions connected with ending the proof, so the code is very
tricky.  You _can_ insert the symbol by hand, but the
(apparently) original ''automatic'' solution came with Paul Taylor's
[`QED`](https://ctan.org/pkg/QED).

Nowadays, the [`ntheorem`](https://ctan.org/pkg/ntheorem) package now solves the problem for
LaTeX users: it provides an automatic way of signalling
the end of a proof.

The AMSLaTeX package [`amsthm`](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsthm) also provides a
`proof` environment that does the job; though you need to
insert a `\qedhere` command if the proof ends with a displayed
equation:
```latex
\begin{proof}
  text...
  \begin{equation*}
    maths... \tag*{\qedhere}
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
```
The `\tag*{`\qedhere`}` construction may be used in any of
AMSLaTeX's numbering environments.
