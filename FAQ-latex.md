title: What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a TeX macro package, originally written by Leslie Lamport, that
provides a document processing system.  LaTeX allows markup to
describe the structure of a document, so that the user
need not think about presentation. By using document classes and
add-on packages, the same document can be produced in a variety of
different layouts.

Lamport says that LaTeX
"_represents a balance between functionality and ease of use_".
This shows itself as a continual conflict that leads to
the need for such things as FAQs: LaTeX _can_ 
meet most user requirements, but finding out _how_ is often
tricky.
