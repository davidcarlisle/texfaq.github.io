PicTeX is a set of macros by Michael Wichura for drawing diagrams
and pictures. The
macros are freely available; however, the
PicTeX manual itself is not free.
Unfortunately, TUG is no longer able to supply copies of the
manual (as it once did), and it is now available only through [Personal
TeX Inc](https://pctex.com/), the vendors of PCTeX.  The
manual is _not_ available electronically.

However, there _is_ a summary of PicTeX commands available on
CTAN, which is a great aide-memoire for those who basically
know the package to start with.
