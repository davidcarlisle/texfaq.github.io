There's not usually a lot to do after you've completed the steps
above&nbsp;&mdash; indeed, if you're merely installed files direct from the
archive, or whatever, there will be precisely nothing left, by way of
debris.

Things you might care to clean up are:
  

-  the archive file, if you retrieved your data from the archive
    as a `zip` file, or the like;
-  the `dtx` and `ins` files, if you chose not
    to install them with the documentation; and
-  the `aux`, `log`, `idx`, etc.,
    from building the documentation.

A simple way of achieving all this is to download to a working
directory that was created for the purpose, and then to delete that
directory and all its contents after you've finished installing.
