title: LaTeX gets cross-references wrong

Sometimes, however many times you run LaTeX, the cross-references
are just wrong.  A likely reason is that you have placed the label
before the data for the label was set; if the label is recording a
`\caption` command, the `\label` command must appear
_after_ the `\caption` command, or be part of it. For example:
```latex
\begin{figure}
  <the illustration itself>
  \caption{My figure}
  \label{myfig}
\end{figure}
```
is correct, as is
<!-- {% raw %} -->
```latex
\begin{figure}
  <the illustration itself>
  \caption{My figure%
    \label{myfig}}
\end{figure}
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->
whereas, in
```latex
\begin{figure}
  <the illustration itself>
  \label{myfig}
  \caption{My figure}
\end{figure}
```
the label will report the number of the section (or whatever) in which
the surrounding text resides, or the like.

You can, with the same malign effect, shield the `\caption` command
from its associated `\label` command, by enclosing the caption in an
environment of its own.  This effect will be seen with:
```latex
\begin{figure}
  <the illustration itself>
  \caption{A Figure}
\end{figure}
\label{myfig}
```
where the `\label` definitely _is_ after the `\caption`,
but because the `figure` environment closed before the
`\label` command, the `\caption` is no longer "visible".

In summary, the `\label` must be _after_ the command that
defines it (e.g., `\caption`), and if the `\caption` is inside
an environment, the `\label` must be in there too.
