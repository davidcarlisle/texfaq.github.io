From a situation where every (La)TeX user _had_ to buy a book
if she was not to find herself groping blindly along, we now have what
almost amounts to an embarrassment of riches of online documentation.
The following answers attempt to create lists of sources "by topic".

First we have introductory manuals, for
[Plain TeX](FAQ-man-tex) and [LaTeX](FAQ-man-latex).

Next comes a selection of
["specialised" (La)TeX tutorials](FAQ-tutbitslatex),
each of which concentrates on a single LaTeX topic.

A small selection of reference documents (it would be good to have
more) are listed in an [answer of their own](FAQ-ref-doc).

Next comes the (somewhat newer) field of 
[TeX-related WIKIs](FAQ-doc-wiki).

A rather short list gives us a 
[Typography style tutorial](FAQ-typo-style).
