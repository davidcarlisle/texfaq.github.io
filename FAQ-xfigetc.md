`(X)Fig` is a menu driven tool that allows you to
draw objects on the screen of an X workstation; `transfig`
is a set of tools which translate the code `fig`.  The list
of export formats is very long, and includes MetaFont and MetaPost,
Encapsulated PostScript and PDF, as well as combinations that wrap
a graphics format in a LaTeX import file, which may include
LaTeX commands to place text (compiled by LaTeX itself) as
labels, etc., in the figures.

There's no explicit port of `xfig` to windows (although it is
believed to work under `cygwin` with its X-windows system).
However, the program 
[`jfig`](https://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades/classdoc/overview-summary.html)
is thought by many to be an acceptable substitute, written in Java.

`Asymptote` is a widely-praised development of the MetaPost
language, which can draw 2D or 3D diagrams, and can also label
diagrams with LaTeX text; copious documentation is available via
[`asymptote`s web site](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net).
