# How should I pronounce ''LaTeX(2<sub>&epsilon;</sub>)''?

Lamport never recommended how one should pronounce LaTeX, but a lot
of people pronounce it ''Lay TeX'' or perhaps ''Lah TeX'' (with
TeX pronounced as the program itself; see
[the rules for TeX](FAQ-TeXpronounce)).  It is definitely
_not_ to be pronounced in the same way as the rubber-tree gum
(which would be ''lay teks'').

The LaTeX2e logo is supposed to end with an
&epsilon;; nevertheless, most
people pronounce the name as ''LaTeX-two-ee''.
