If you're printing something that's eventually to be reproduced in
significant quantities, and bound, it's conventional to print on paper
larger than your target product, and to place ''crop marks'' outside
the printed area.  These crop marks are available to the production
house, for lining up reproduction and trimming machines.

You can save yourself the (considerable) trouble of programming these
marks for yourself by using the package [`crop`](https://ctan.org/pkg/crop), which has
facilities to satisfy any conceivable production house.  Users of the
[`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) class don't need the package, since [`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) has
its own facilities for programming crop marks.
