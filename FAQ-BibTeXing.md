# BibTeX Documentation

BibTeX, a program originally designed to produce bibliographies in
conjunction with LaTeX, is explained in Section&nbsp;4.3 and Appendix&nbsp;B
of Leslie Lamport's LaTeX manual.
The document ''BibTeXing'', in the BibTeX distribution (look for
`btxdoc`),
expands on the chapter in Lamport's book.  _The LaTeX Companion_
also has information on BibTeX and writing BibTeX style files.
(See [LaTeX books](FAQ-latex-books) for details of both
books.)

The web site ''[Your BibTeX resource](http://www.bibtex.org)''
offers a solid introduction, but doesn't go into very great detail.

The document ''Designing BibTeX Styles'', also in the BibTeX
distribution (look for
`btxhak`), explains the postfix stack-based language used to
write BibTeX styles (`.bst` files). The file`btxbst.doc`,
also in the BibTeX distribution,
is the template for the four standard styles ([`plain`](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex),
[`abbrv`](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex), [`alpha`](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex), and [`unsrt`](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex)); it also
contains their documentation.

A useful tutorial of the whole process of using BibTeX is Nicolas
Markey's ''_Tame the BeaST (The B to X of BibTeX)_'', which
may also be found on CTAN.  A summary and FAQ by Michael
Shell and David Hoadley, is also to be recommended.
