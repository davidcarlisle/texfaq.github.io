The [LaTeX project](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3/)
is a small group of volunteers whose aim is
to produce a major new document processing system based on the
principles pioneered by Leslie Lamport in the current LaTeX.  The
new system is (provisionally) called LaTeX3; it
will remain freely available and it will be fully documented at
all levels.

The LaTeX team's first product (LaTeX2e) was delivered in 1994
(it's now properly called "LaTeX", since no other version is current).

LaTeX2e was intended as a consolidation exercise, unifying several
sub-variants of LaTeX while changing nothing whose change wasn't
absolutely necessary.  This has permitted the team to support a single
version of LaTeX, in parallel with development of LaTeX3.

Some of the older discussion papers about directions for LaTeX3 are
to be found on CTAN; other (published) articles are to be found
on the [project web site](https://www.latex-project.org/publications/).

The projects code is all available on the [project's GitHub
site](https://github.com/latex3/):

- [The LaTeX2e kernel](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e)
- [The LaTeX3 development repository](https://github.com/latex3/latex3)

Release code from the team is also available on CTAN, most notably

- [`l3kernel`](https://ctan.org/pkg/l3kernel): Core programming support for
  LaTeX3 work (the `expl3` language)
- [`l3packages`](https://ctan.org/pkg/l3packages): Stable packages using
  LaTeX3 ideas
- [`l3experimental`](https://ctan.org/pkg/l3experimental): More experimental
  code

Anyone may participate in discussions of the future of LaTeX through the
mailing list `LaTeX-L`; some development work (outside the project) is
discussed on the list. Subscribe to the list by sending a message `subscribe
latex-l <your name>` to <listserv@urz.Uni-Heidelberg.de>
