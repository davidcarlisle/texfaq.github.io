The FAQ will never be complete, and we always expect that
there will be people out there who know better than we do about
something or other.  We always need to be put right about whatever
we've got wrong, and suggestions for improvements, particularly
covering areas we've missed, are always needed. Please
[log an issue](https://github.com/tex-faq/tex-faq.github.io/issues)
and we'll look at it.

If you have actual material to submit, your contribution is more than ever
welcome. The FAQ use [GitHub-flavoured
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for the
content: see [CONTRIBUTING.md] for more details of specific local
considerations. You can include your suggested text in an issue report, or
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/tex-faq/tex-faq.github.io/pulls).
(If you don't understand what that means, don't worry!)
