You specified placement `[htbp]` for your full-width figure or
table, but they always get placed at the top of the page&hellip;  Well,
it _is_ what the documentation says: LaTeX, unadorned, only
allows full-width floats at the top of a page, or occupying (part of) a
float page.

The package [`nidanfloat`](https://ctan.org/pkg/nidanfloat) supports `[b]` placement of a
full-width figure in a two-column document even on the first page of a
document.

Barbara Beeton's article
[Placing a full-width insert at the bottom of two columns](https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb35-3/tb111beet-banner.pdf) in TUGboat 35(3)
gives a manual method for doing the same.

The [`stfloats`](https://ctan.org/pkg/stfloats) package also ameliorates the situation somewhat, and
makes LaTeX honour ''[b]'' placement as well; the
[`dblfloatfix`](https://ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix) package combines a tidied version of the changes
made in [`stfloats`](https://ctan.org/pkg/stfloats) with the
  [float ordering corrections](FAQ-2colfltorder) defined in
  [`fixltx2e`](https://ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e).

A particular problem with [`stfloats`](https://ctan.org/pkg/stfloats) and [`dblfloatfix`](https://ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix)
is that the float will appear, at its earliest, on the page after it
is specified.  This has two undesirable side-effects: first, there may
be no bottom float on the first page of a document, and second, float
numbers may become ''entangled'' (particularly if you're using
[`dblfloatfix`](https://ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix) that ensures that the early-specified bottom
float is set _before_ any single column floats).

(The FAQ team doesn't know of any package that will make
LaTeX honour ''[h]'' placement of double-column floats, but the
[`midfloat`](https://ctan.org/pkg/midfloat) package can be pressed into service to provide
something approximating the effect it would have.)
