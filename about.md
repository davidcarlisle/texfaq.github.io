This is a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for English-speaking users of
TeX. The information is maintained by a [group of
''curators'']({{ "/" | absolute_url }}), with contributions from a very wide
range of people over many years.

The questions answered here cover a wide range of topics, but typesetting
issues are mostly covered from the viewpoint of a LaTeX user.

It's easier to add information than it is to decide that information is no
longer needed: questions are therefore not deleted but are ''retired'' (removed
from the main index) over time.
