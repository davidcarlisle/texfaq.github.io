For TeX primitive commands a rather nice 
[quick reference booklet](http://www.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/texcrib.pdf),
by John W.&nbsp;Shipman, is available; it's arranged in the same way as the
TeXbook.  By contrast, you can view David Bausum's 
[list of TeX primitives](http://www.tug.org/utilities/plain/cseq.html)
alphabetically or arranged by "family".  Either way, the list has a
link for each control sequence, that leads you to a detailed
description, which includes page references to the TeXbook.

There doesn't seem to be a reference that takes in Plain TeX as
well as the primitive commands.

An interesting LaTeX "cheat sheet" is available from CTAN:
it's a list of (more or less) everything you 'ought to' remember, for
basic LaTeX use. 
(It's laid out very compactly for printing on N. American 'letter';
printed on ISO A4, using Adobe Acrobat's "shrink to fit",
it strains aged eyes&hellip;) 

For command organised references to LaTeX,  Karl Berry (et
al)'s 
[LaTeX reference manual](https://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/software/latexrefman/) is (to
an extent) work in progress, but is generally reliable (source is
available on the.archive as well).

Martin Scharrer's "List of internal LaTeX macros" is a help to
those aiming to write a class or package.

The reference provided by the Emerson Center of Emory
University), 
[LaTeXe help](http://www.emerson.emory.edu/services/latex/latex2e/latex2e_toc.html)
also looks good.
