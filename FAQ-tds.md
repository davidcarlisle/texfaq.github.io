TDS is an acronym for "TeX Directory Structure"; it
specifies a standard way of organising all the TeX-related files on
a computer system.

Most modern distributions arrange their TeX files in conformance
with the TDS, using both a "distribution" directory tree and a
(set of) "local" directory trees, each containing TeX-related
files.  The TDS recommends the name `texmf` for the name
of the root directory (folder) of an hierarchy; in practice there are
typically several such trees, each of which has a name that compounds
that (e.g., `texmf-dist`, `texmf-var`).

Files supplied as part of the distribution are put into the
distribution's tree, but the location of the distribution's hierarchy is
system dependent.  (On a Unix system it might be at
`/usr/share/texmf` or `/opt/texmf`, or a similar location.)

There may be more than one "local" hierarchy in which additional files
can be stored.  An installation will also typically offer a local
hierarchy, while each user may have an individual local hierarchy.

The TDS itself is published as the output of a TUG 
[Technical Working Group](FAQ-TUGstar).  You may browse an
[on-line version](https://tug.org/tds/) of the standard, and
copies in several other formats (including source) are available on
CTAN.
