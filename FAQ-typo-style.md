Peter Wilson's article [`memdesign`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memdesign) has a lengthy introductory
section on typographic considerations, which is a fine tutorial,
written by someone who is aware of the issues as they apply to
(La)TeX users.  ([`Memdesign`](https://ctan.org/pkg/Memdesign) now distributed separately from
the manual for his [`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) class, but was originally part of
that manual)

There's also (at least one) typographic style tutorial available on
the Web, the excellent 
"[Guidelines for Typography in NBCS](http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/typography.janson-syntax.107514.pdf)".
In fact, its 
[parent page](http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/index.html)
is also worth a read: among other things, it provides copies of the
"guidelines" document in a wide variety of primary fonts, for
comparison purposes.  The author is careful to explain that he has no
ambition to supplant such excellent books as
[Bringhurst's](FAQ-type-books), but the document (though it does
contain its Rutgers-local matter) is a fine introduction to the issues
of producing readable documents.
