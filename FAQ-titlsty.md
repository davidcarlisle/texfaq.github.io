The [`titling`](https://ctan.org/pkg/titling) package provides a number of facilities that
permit manipulation of the appearance of a `\maketitle` command, the
`\thanks` commands within it, and so on.  The package also defines a
`titlingpage` environment, that offers something in between the
standard classes' `titlepage` option and the `titlepage`
environment, and is itself somewhat configurable.

The memoir class includes all the functionality of the
[`titling`](https://ctan.org/pkg/titling) package, while the [`KOMA-script`](https://ctan.org/pkg/KOMA-script) classes have
their own range of different titling styles.

Finally, the indefatigable Vincent Zoonekynd supplies examples of how
to program alternative 
[title styles](http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_title/0.html).
The web page is not useful to users unless they are willing to do
their own LaTeX programming.
