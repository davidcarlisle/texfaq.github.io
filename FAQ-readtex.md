So you've been sent an (La)TeX file: what are you going to do with
it?

You can, of course, "just read it", since it's a plain text file;
the problem is that the markup tags in the document may prove
distracting.  Most of the time, even TeX _experts_ will
typeset a (La)TeX file before attempting to read it&nbsp;&hellip;

So you shouldn't be too concerned if you can't make head nor tail of
the file: it is designed to be read by a (sort of) compiler, and
compilers don't have much in common with human readers.

A possible next step is to try an on-line LaTeX editor.  There are
many of these&nbsp;&mdash; a compilation of links may be found in 
[this blog post](http://texblog.net/latex-link-archive/online-compiler/)

If no online compiler helps, you need to typeset the document
"yourself".  The good news is that TeX systems are available,
free, for most sorts of computer; the bad news is that you need a
pretty complete TeX system even to read a single file, and complete
TeX systems are pretty large.

TeX is a typesetting system that arose from a publishing project (see
"[What is TeX?](FAQ-whatTeX)"),
and its basic source is available free from its author.  However, at
its root, it is _just_ a typesetting engine: even to view or to
print the typeset output, you will need ancillary programs.  In short,
you need a TeX _distribution_&nbsp;&mdash; a collection of
TeX-related programs tailored to your operating system: for details
of the sorts of things that are available, see
"[TeX distributions](FAQ-TeXsystems)"
or
"[commercial TeX distributions](FAQ-commercial)".

But beware&nbsp;&mdash; TeX makes no attempt to look like the sort of
WYSIWYG system you're probably used to (see
"[Why is TeX not WYSIWYG?](FAQ-notWYSIWYG)"):
while many modern versions of TeX have a compile&ndash;view cycle that
rivals the best commercial word processors in its responsiveness, what
you type is usually _markup_, which typically defines a logical
(rather than a visual) view of what you want typeset.

So there's a balance between the simplicity of the original
(marked-up) document, which can more-or-less be read in _any_
editor, and the really rather large investment needed to install a
system to read a document "as intended".

Are you "put off" by all this?&nbsp;&mdash; remember that TeX is good at
producing PDF: why not ask the person who sent the TeX file
to send an PDF copy?
