# Books on other TeX-related matters

There's a nicely-presented list of of ''recommended books'' to be had
on the web: [http://www.macrotex.net/texbooks/]

The list of MetaFont books is rather short:

- The MetaFont book by Donald Knuth (Addison Wesley, 1986,
  ISBN-10 0-201-13445-4, ISBN-10 0-201-52983-1 paperback)

Alan Hoenig's '_TeX Unbound_' includes some discussion and
examples of using MetaFont.

A book covering a wide range of topics (including installation and
maintenance) is:

- Making TeX Work by Norman Walsh (O'Reilly and Associates,
  Inc, 1994, ISBN-10 1-56592-051-1)

The book is decidedly dated, and is now out of print, but a copy is
available via `sourceforge` and on CTAN, 
and we list it under ''[online books](FAQ-ol-books)''.
