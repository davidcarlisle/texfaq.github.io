TeXCAD is a program for the PC which enables the user to draw diagrams
on screen using a mouse or arrow keys, with an on-screen menu of available 
picture-elements. Its output is code for the LaTeX
`picture` environment. 
Optionally, it can be set to include lines at all angles using 
the emTeX driver-family
[`\special`s](FAQ-specials).
TeXCAD is part of the emTeX distribution.

A Unix port of the program (`xtexcad`) has been made.
