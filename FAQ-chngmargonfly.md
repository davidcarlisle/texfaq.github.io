One of the surprises characteristic of TeX use is that you cannot
change the width or height of the text within the document, simply by
modifying the text size parameters; TeX can't change the text width
on the fly, and LaTeX only ever looks at text height when starting
a new page.

So the simple rule is that the parameters should only be
changed in the preamble of the document, i.e., before the
`\begin{document}` statement (so before any typesetting has
happened.

To adjust text width within a document we define an environment:
<!-- {% raw %} -->
```latex
\newenvironment{changemargin}[2]{%
  \begin{list}{}{%
    \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}%
    \setlength{\leftmargin}{#1}%
    \setlength{\rightmargin}{#2}%
    \setlength{\listparindent}{\parindent}%
    \setlength{\itemindent}{\parindent}%
    \setlength{\parsep}{\parskip}%
  }%
  \item[]}{\end{list}}
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->
The environment takes two arguments, and will indent the left and
right margins, respectively, by the parameters' values. Negative
values will cause the margins to be narrowed, so
`\begin{changemargin}{-1cm}{-1cm}` narrows the left and right
margins by 1 centimetre.

Given that TeX can't do this, how does it work?&nbsp;&mdash; well, the
environment (which is a close relation of the LaTeX
`quote` environment) _doesn't_ change the text width
as far as TeX is concerned: it merely moves text around inside the
width that TeX believes in.

The [`changepage`](https://ctan.org/pkg/changepage) package provides ready-built commands to do
the above; it includes provision for changing the shifts applied to
your text according to whether you're on an odd (_recto_) or an
even (_verso_) page of a two-sided document.
[`Changepage`](https://ctan.org/pkg/Changepage)'s structure matches that of the [`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir)
class.

The (earlier) package [`chngpage`](https://ctan.org/pkg/chngpage) provides the same facilities,
but it uses rather different syntax.  [`Changepage`](https://ctan.org/pkg/Changepage)'s structure
matches that of the [`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) class, and it should be used for
any new work.

Changing the vertical dimensions of a page is more clumsy still: the
LaTeX command `\enlargethispage` adjusts the size of the current
page by the size of its argument.  Common uses are
```latex
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
```
to make the page one line longer, or
```latex
\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}
```
to make the page one line shorter.  The process is (to an extent)
simplified by the [`addlines`](https://ctan.org/pkg/addlines) package: its `\addlines`
command takes as argument the _number_ of lines to add to the
page (rather than a length): the package documentation also provides a
useful analysis of when the command may (or may not) be expected to
work.
