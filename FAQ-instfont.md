Fonts are really ''just another package'', and so should be installed
in the same sort of way as packages.  However, fonts tend to be more
complicated than the average package, and as a result it's sometimes
difficult to see the overall structure.

Font files may appear in any of a large number of different formats;
each format has a different function in a TeX system, and each is
stored in a directory its own sub-tree in the installation's
TDS tree; all these sub-trees have the directory
`$TEXMF/fonts` 
as their root.  A sequence of answers describes the
installation of fonts:
