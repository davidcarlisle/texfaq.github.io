While the FAQ maintainers don't offer a "help" service, they're
very keen that you understand the answers they've already written.
They're (almost) written "in a vacuum", to provide something to
cover a set of questions that have arisen; it's always possible that
they're written in a way that a novice won't understand them.

Which is where you can help the community.  Log an issue on the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/tex-faq/tex-faq.github.io/issues) for
the FAQ to report the answer that you find unclear, and (if you can) suggest
what we need to clarify.  Time permitting (the team is small and all
its members are busy), we'll try and clarify the answer.  This way,
with a bit of luck, we can together improve the value of this resource
to the whole community.
