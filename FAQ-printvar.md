It is often useful to print out the values of variables in the log
file or on the terminal.  Three possible ways to print out the
contents of `\textheight` variable are:
  

1.  `\showthe\textheight`
2.  `\message{The text height is \the\textheight}`
3.  `\typeout{The text height is \the\textheight}`

These techniques use the TeX primitives `\the` (which provides
the value of a variable), `\showthe` (print a variable to the
terminal and the log, on a line of its own), and `\message`, which
interpolates something into the log.  The command `\typeout` is
LaTeX's general message output mechanism.

In each case, the variable's value is printed as a number of points.

To typeset the value of `\textheight`, just
`\the\textheight` is enough, but a more flexible alternative is
to use the [`printlen`](https://ctan.org/pkg/printlen) package.  [`Printlen`](https://ctan.org/pkg/Printlen) allows you
to choose the units in which you print a variable; this is useful,
given that the most ordinary people don't think in points
(particularly Knuth's points, of which there are 72.27 to the inch).

So, using [`printlen`](https://ctan.org/pkg/printlen), we could say:
```latex
\newlength{\foo}
\setlength{\foo}{12pt}
\verb|\foo| is \printlength{\foo}
```
and get:
`\foo` is 12pt
while, if we say:
```latex
\newlength{\foo}
\setlength{\foo}{12pt}
\uselengthunit{mm}
\verb|foo| is \printlength{\foo}
```
we get:
`\foo` is 4.21747mm
